Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 Â± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).\n",

      "    Decision:ILC2s are increased in CRSwNP and eosinophilic CRS, but not in non-eCRS and asthma patients. The increase in ILC2s in CRSwNP is associated with co-existing asthma, suggesting a potential link between ILC2s and airway inflammation. ILC2s may play a role in the development of CRSwNP and the pathogenesis of airway inflammation in CRSwNP patients. The association between ILC2s and eosinophilic CRS suggests that ILC2s may be involved in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP and eosinophilic CRS. The association between ILC2s and nasal symptom score in CRSwNP patients may indicate that ILC2s are involved in the development of nasal symptoms in CRSwNP.\n"
